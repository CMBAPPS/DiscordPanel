DiscordPanel 
 
What is is?
DiscordPanel is a HTML, PHP, CSS, JS, and more designed discord bot software what works as a panel. Currently you can, restart, stop and start a bot from the panel. You can have an unlimited number of bots added as long as you have the details. There is a rated development knowledge of 4.5/10 to use this script. There is a To-Do page and widget on the home screen too, and a bug screen coming soon! The whole code is open source, what is amazing! 
 
Why use DiscordPanel? 
We own and run around 14 discord bots what are on hundreds of thousands discord servers, so downtime can impact us a lot. So our lead developer designed a software called DiscordPanel the only free self hosted discord bot control panel. If your bot is on discordbots.org then you can use the status widget on the homescreen, but don't worry as in a future update we will be adding another way to use the status widget.
