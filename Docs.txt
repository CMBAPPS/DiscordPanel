HOW TO UPDATE FROM 1.2:
1. Open up these files: "bot1.php", "bot2.php", "bot3.php", "bot4.php", "index.php", and "todolist.php"
2. On all bot files (1-4) edit lines "14" to "22" and replace the all of it with:

#################
<?php
if(!empty($_POST['lobby-stop'])) { #Watch if the button is pressed
    $ssh->exec('killall -9 node'); #Execution in SSH
}

if(!empty($_POST['lobby-restart'])) { #Watch if the button is pressed
    $ssh->exec('cd /folder; node bot.js'); #Execution in SSH
}
?>
#################

3. Change the bot directory back to what you used before (Edit "folder")
4. Do that for all bot files (1 though 4)
5. On bot files 1 though 4 go to line "101" and make a new line (removing all spaces)
6. Paste this code there:

#################
                    <li>
                        <a href="bugs.php">
                            <i class="fas fa-bug"></i>
                            <p>Bugs</p>
                        </a>
                    </li>
#################

7. Repeate this for the other bot files.
8. Open file "Index.php", and "todolist.php"
9. Go to lines "78" and make a new line (removing all spaces)
10. Paste in this code:

#################
                    <li>
                        <a href="bugs.php">
                            <i class="fas fa-bug"></i>
                            <p>Bugs</p>
                        </a>
                    </li>
#################

11. Repeate this for both files.
12. Save all files.


Setup SQL:
In the first version of DiscordPanel there weas just ToDOList but we have now added a bug area. So we will need to uplkoad the table to the current SQL for the to-do-list.
1. Go to the sql database in a thing like phpmyadmin
2. Locate the database you have for DiscordPanel
3. Click "Import"
4. Locate the SQL file "Update/Sql/bugssql.sql" and upload it (Clicking "GO")
5. This should then be done!
6. Go to the file "bug/dbconnect.php" and enter the same login details for the database that "php/dbconnect.php" will have
7. Save and test!



To add an item to Bugs:
As long as you've set up the panel right with SQL you should be able to click on the “Bugs” link on the side navbar and the Bugs page will open
Click on “Enter bug here...”
Then write something on the todo list there
Click on “Submit”
You should get an alert if it works


To edit a Bug:
Go to the Bug page
Under the item on the Bug page, there will be a text box with a green tick next to it
Write the new detail in that text box then click the tick
If successful an alert will popup


To remove an item from Bugs:
There are two ways to do this…
Go to the main (Home) page and click on the red “-” logo next to the item you want to remove the widget
If successful an alert will popup
Or
Go to the Bugs page
Click the red “-” logo next to the item you want to remove
If successful an alert will popup
